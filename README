- sign up to sandbox to test API
- received merchant id and others keys in the attachment of the reply email

create simple test button using google ai studio
add merchat id and api url
click the button test from google ai studio but failed with error.request -> empty
now download the code and run it from local host, run from locahost fail, but run with postman succeed

now will deploy the project to google cloud run
use cloud run is complicated because i need docker file and use cloud build to build docker file failed
now use https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=blueprint&noreferrer=true 
deploy on render still run fail because we cannot call api url directly from react front end

now adding backend/server.js the payment api. this func will call payway api
react will call this backend 
render will deploy backend service
we can run front end locally and click on the button to call pay (our backend). now it is working
